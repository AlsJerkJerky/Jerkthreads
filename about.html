  <h1>About Us – Jerk Threads</h1>
  <p><strong>Built with love. Stitched with purpose.</strong></p>
  <p>Welcome to <strong>Jerk Threads</strong>, the bold, unapologetic brand created by a real couple—with a twist.<br>
  <em>She is the beauty. I am the beast.</em> Together, we’re building something loud, loyal, and legendary.</p>
  <p>What started as jerky turned into shirts, but the spirit stayed the same: <strong>Raw. Real. Unfiltered.</strong></p>
  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>She brings the grace. I bring the grit.<br>
  She brings the heart. I bring the hustle.<br>
  Every shirt we drop is made with both—because this brand is more than fabric. It’s <strong>family</strong>.</p>
  <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <blockquote>
    To wear what matters, print what’s real, and honor love, loyalty, and the power of believing in your own story.<br>
    <strong>Jerk Threads</strong> exists for the rebels, the hodlers, and the believers who refuse to blend in.
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Our Promise</h2>
  <p><strong>If you can dream it, I can make it.<br>Your wish is my command, deary.</strong></p>
